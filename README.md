A tiny repo that shows how GitHub blocks pushes that contain a private email address.
If you enable the “Block command line pushes that expose my email” setting, GitHub will warn you before your email reaches the public history.

This repo is just a safe sandbox to demonstrate that feature.

---- 

Turn it on:

1️⃣ Settings → Emails
2️⃣ Enable Block command line pushes that expose my email

Stay safe :)
